# Instructions
Compile all files and run Game.java to play crazy8 against a computer. To play a card enter the number of the card in the hand when prompted. The first card on the "table" will be taken from the deck. The player will go first and can choose any card that has the same suit or denomoniation of the card in play. Playing a card with an 8 will allow the player to choose the suit of the card the computer must place. If the player does not have a legal card or an 8, they must draw from the deck until they have a legal card. The winner is the first person to place down all their cards. 

# Design Choices
I chose to use Java for this project because it is the language I am most comfortable with and can easily use Object Oriented Programming. I used ArrayLists to hold the Card objects because it is easy to modify. I wanted to for this so that I can have a card class that will have the characteristics of the card (suit and denomination), a deck class that will have all the methods that involves cards like placing a card down, drawing a card, dealing cards and a game class that is the driver. To test the program instead of dealing random cards I hard coded select cards in the hands of the player and computer.
